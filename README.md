# isBraceBalanced
This program accepts a string from user then checks for brackets if the string doesn't contain any brackets it outputs 
"Error, String doesn't contain any brackets" 
If the string has brackets it checks the order of brackets to check if brackets are balanced we define balanced as - if there's an opening bracket then there should be a closing bracket of the same kind e.g () []  {} in this case the brackets are balanced.  
where the brackets start with a closing bracket or there exist an opening bracket with no closing the the string is not balanced
